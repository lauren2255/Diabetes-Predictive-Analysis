# Diabetes Predictive Analysis

### Overview
This project analyzed a diabetes prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes variables such as ID, gender, age, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, diabetes diagnosis, hypertension, and heart disease. The goal was to identify factors influencing the development of diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, and determine which variables are most accurate at predicting diabetes.

### Methodology
1. **Data Exploration:** Explored the dataset to understand its structure and variables.
2. **Statistical Analysis:** Utilized hypothesis testing and correlation coefficient testing to examine relationships between variables.
3. **Visualization:** Created various visualizations including bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, and line charts to illustrate insights from the data.
4. **Conclusion:** Drawn conclusions based on statistical analysis and visualization findings.

### Findings
1. **Correlation with Diabetes:** BMI, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels positively correlate with diabetes diagnosis.
2. **Correlation with Hypertension and Heart Disease:** BMI positively correlates with hypertension and heart disease.
3. **Predictive Factors:** BMI, HbA1c levels, and blood glucose levels appear to be significant predictors of diabetes.
